Server log directory

Output any necessary logs to this directory in the following format:

    [MODULE_NAME]_[FILE_NAME]_[TIMESTAMP].log
    
    where TIMESTAMP follows the following format: 'dmy-Hi-u'

For example, if log output is created from 'form.php' within the module 'foo',
your log output should then be sent to:

    foo_form_050712-1351-654321.log
